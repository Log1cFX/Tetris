absolutetly dog***t project but at the end I learned that I don't know s**t and I need to learn more. it's been 5 months and now I'm learning C and a lot of new stuff about micro chips thanks to popos123 (Tomasz Desaniuk). I'm not learning patterns yet because it's so boring but I'll eventually make an update or even another project from scratch with the best code possible, because this is unacceptable
